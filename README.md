# Amazon Price Tracker

A Python script that tracks the price of a product on Amazon and sends an email alert when the price drops below a specified threshold. This project uses web scraping to fetch product information and an SMTP server to send email notifications.

## Features

- Tracks a specified product on Amazon.
- Notifies via email when the price falls below a specified threshold.
- Configurable target price, email, and product URL.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`, `smtplib`

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

## Setup

1. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-price-tracker.git
   ```
   Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd amazon-price-tracker
   ```

2. **Update Script with Product Details**:
   - In `price_tracker.py`, update the `link` variable with the Amazon URL of the product you want to track.
   - Set your desired `buy_price` as the target price to receive alerts.

3. **Email Setup**:
   - Update the `my_email` variable with your email address.
   - **Enable 2-Step Verification** in your Google account and create an **App Password** under Google Account Security settings.
   - Replace the `password` variable with this app password. **Do not use your main Gmail password**.

   **Note**: For enhanced security, consider using environment variables to store sensitive information.

## Usage

Run the script to check the current price and receive an email alert if the price meets or drops below your target price:
```bash
python price_tracker.py
```

### Scheduling Price Checks (Optional)

To monitor prices regularly, schedule this script with:
- **Cron** (Linux/Mac): Add a cron job to run the script at regular intervals.
- **Task Scheduler** (Windows): Set up a task to run the script at specific times.

## Important Security Note

This script contains sensitive information (email and password). Avoid pushing sensitive data to a public repository. Use environment variables for secure storage of credentials in production environments.
